# Karabiner-Elements Presets
As a long-time Windows user, entering MacOS was really jarring. I was used to smacking the Win key and typing out whatever I wanted to search and getting quick web results. That's why I started mapping my command key to Spotlight search. These files are advanced configurations I've made since then to improve my experience, mostly focusing on the power of the Command key.

- You can find old versions and deprecated presets in the v1 folder
- You can read more about the presets in the [presets](PRESETS.MD) readme

# Installation
> Before choosing your presets, install "Control to Command" first.

After installing Karabiner-Elements to your MacOS system:
- Navigate to the **Complex Modifications** tab in the Karabiner-Elements App
- Click the *Add Your Own Rule* button
- Replace the entire contents of the text box with the contents of one of these files
