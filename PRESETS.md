# The Presets

> Some previous versions and deprecated presets are available in the v1 folder. Read this outline first to understand what the core shortcuts do.

### Control to Command > *ctrl-to-cmd.json*
This file maps any press of the Control key to the Command key, as most shortcuts in MacOS primarily use Command.

### Quick Spotlight / Command to Control Shortcuts > *macos-quick-spotlight.json* 
This file maps a tap on the Command key to open Spotlight Search. If the Command key is used with another key, it falls back to a Control + Key shortcut. This allows Control to be used in situations where needed, like terminals.

### Pause to Lock Screen > *pause-locks-screen.json*
This file maps the Pause key to the Command + Control + Q key combination, which locks the screen. This is a replacement for my brain-trained Win + L to lock command. Unneeded if you only use an Apple keyboard, just press your fancy lock button :)

### Print Screen to Screenshot > *print-screen-capture.json*
This file maps the Print Screen key on a full keyboard to the Command + Shift + 5 key combination, which opens the screenshot app, similar to how Windows will launch Snipping Tool.
